#### Learn about some of the cool tools that every BIM professional should have in their toolbox. <br>

**What makes a great BIM professional?**<br>

Well, that all depends on the tools they have. You can have all the knowledge in the world but if you don’t have the right tools, you are not able to demonstrate your value.
Now, everyone knows that one of the key factors to a BIM professional’s success lies in support throughout the organisation. They need to have buy in from the c level executives all the way to the end user.<br>

But the BIM professional also requires a robust but ever evolving set of tools in their toolbox. In this blog, I will discuss the tools that I have found helpful so far.<br> 

1. **Common Data Environment** - the common data environment is a central repository where project data is stored - most commonly in the cloud. This central repository allows for efficient management of information and assets. It allows teams - internally or externally- to share and securely access data from any device or location. This is ideal in the post pandemic and global world we are living in today.<br>

1. **Collaborative software solutions** - this tool or set of tools allows professionals to work simultaneously on the same design with the possibility of duplicated or lost data. This tool must also have interoperability features, transparency of workflows, flexibility in design features and the ability to append meta data.<br>

1. **Communication platform** - A lay form that allows team members to quickly communicate with each other is essential. The BIM professions efficiency lies in good communication. This tool must allow for a variety of communication techniques and ideally, a connection to project data and other business tools, such as a calendar.
Spreadsheet solution - spreadsheets are still efficient ways of transferring, analysing and editing data. And their intuitiveness means they are accessible to those who are not developers.<br>

1. **A sense of humour** - because without it life would be boring.<br>
